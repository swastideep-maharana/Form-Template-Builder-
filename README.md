# Form Template Builder

Welcome! 👋

This project is a modern, user-friendly **Form Template Builder** built with React and TypeScript. It lets you create, preview, and use custom form templates—perfect for surveys, onboarding, checklists, and more. The UI is clean, intuitive, and inspired by the best no-code tools out there.

---

## 🚀 What Can You Do?

- **Create up to 5 templates** for any use case.
- **Organize your template** into sections (with custom titles).
- **Add fields** to each section: Label (H1/H2/H3), Short Answer, Number, Yes/No, Dropdown.
- **Drag and drop fields** to reorder them within a section.
- **Edit everything inline**—labels, help text, field type, and required toggle.
- **Delete fields or sections** with a click.
- **Preview your template** in real time or in a modal.
- **Save your work**—everything is stored in your browser (localStorage).
- **Fill out forms** generated from your templates, with validation and data saved locally.
